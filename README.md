🧠 CompanionMind – Patient Onboarding & Hospital Portal

CompanionMind is a dual-portal mental health intake and monitoring system designed to simplify patient onboarding while providing healthcare professionals with structured, actionable patient data.
The Patient Onboarding Portal guides patients through a multi-step, user-friendly workflow to collect:
Demographic and physical information
Emergency contact details
Medical and mental health history
Lifestyle factors relevant to mental well-being
Standardized mental health screening inputs
Each patient submission generates a unique Patient ID, ensuring consistent identification across systems while keeping patient and hospital workflows fully decoupled.
The Hospital Portal operates as a separate web application, accessible only to authorized staff. Clinicians can retrieve onboarding data using the Patient ID and view it in a read-only clinical format, enabling faster assessment, improved triage, and better continuity of care.
CompanionMind leverages OLLAMA to structure and manage onboarding data and is built using HTML5 and modern JavaScript (ES6) for rapid prototyping. The system intentionally uses a frontend-first architecture during the prototype phase, with a modular data model that allows seamless migration to secure backend services, cloud storage, and AI-driven analytics in future iterations.
The platform is ideal for hackathons and early-stage experimentation, demonstrating how AI-assisted data intake, clean system separation, and scalable design principles can be applied to modern digital health solutions.
